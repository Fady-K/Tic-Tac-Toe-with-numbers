1- write all the initiall status of the game ( game running, first game,  board, odd_nums, event_nums)
2- make a function to display the board
3- make a function to display the current game status (contains the function displaying the board)

4- make the first player function
    take input >> (odd num from 1 to 10)
    remove the chosen odd num from odd nums
    take input where to place this odd num in the board
    check if the odd num is in the odd nums, and check if num where to place in range 1-9

5- make the second player function
    take input >> (even num from 1 to 10)
    remove the chosen even num from even nums
    take input where to place this even num on the board
    check if the even num is in the even nums, and check if num where to place in range 1-9


6- make the functions that check all winning cases ( Horizontally, Vertically, Diagonally)

7- check tie (if there is  no empty place on the board)

8- Perform The Following Loop:
    display the initial game status

    while game running >> while true

    call player one function
    display the game status
    check win
        if true end the game
    check tie
        if true end the game


    call player two function
    display game status
    check win
        if true end the game

    check tie
        if true end the game
